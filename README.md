# Statistics-Data-Preprocessing-on-sales-data-with-discount-dataset.
 Descriptive Analytics and Data Preprocessing on Sales &amp; Discounts Dataset.To perform descriptive analytics, visualize data distributions, and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.

# Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns
●	Objective: To compute and analyze basic statistical measures for numerical columns in the dataset.

# Data Visualization
●	Objective: To visualize the distribution and relationship of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.
●	Histograms:
	Plot histograms for each numerical column.
	Analyze the distribution (e.g., skewness, presence of outliers) and provide inferences.
●	Boxplots:
	Create boxplots for numerical variables to identify outliers and the interquartile range.
	Discuss any findings, such as extreme values or unusual distributions.
●	Bar Chart Analysis for Categorical Column:
	Identify categorical columns in the dataset.
	Create bar charts to visualize the frequency or count of each category.
	Analyze the distribution of categories and provide insights.
 
# Standardization of Numerical Variables
●	Objective: To scale numerical variables for uniformity, improving the dataset’s suitability for analytical models.
Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
●	Objective: To transform categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms.

# Summarize the key findings from the descriptive analytics and data visualizations.
